# if labelAllUnlabeledData=true: iterate until all available unlabeled instances are labeled 
# if labelAllUnlabeledData=false: iterate for the predefined number of iterations (coTrainingIterations parameter)
labelAllUnlabeledData=false

# Number of co-training iterations (k). If labelAllUnlabeledData is set to true, this parameter is ignored
coTrainingIterations=20

# Number of instances in small unlabeled pool u'
# If poolSize=0, the small unlabeled pool is not used and the instances are selected directly from unlabeled data
poolSize=50

# Number of examples (per each class) to label and add to initial training set in one iteration of co-training
# In the given example, 5 instances most confidently labeled as "positiveClass" and 5 instances most confidently labeled as "negativeClass" are used 
className="positiveClass" "negativeClass" 
growthSize=5 5

# If testEachIteration=true the strenght co-training classifier in each iteration of co-training will be recorded. 
# Evaluation measures will be written to the file named CTlog_split_i.txt in the specified result folder (i is the ordinal number of 
# the feature split used for co-training as some experiments run co-training multiple times with different feature splits). 
# The result folder is specified in data.properties.
# All measures specified in the used experiment properties will be recorded for both individual classifiers and the combined classifier.  
testEachIteration=true
