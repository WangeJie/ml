# if loadClassifiers=true, load training classifier statistic from the file specified in ClassifiersFileName property.

loadClassifiers=true
# Denotes the file location of the classifier statistic file. If the loadClassifier parameter value is false this property value is ignored.

# label unlabeled instances during execution (settings L and All), i.e. do not create the train statistic,  only the test statistic will

# In this case, the classifier statistics is written for later use in RSSalg and MajorityVote algorithms

#	- algorithms.RSSalg.GA.RSSalgCandidateEvaluator (used for RSSalg setting)
