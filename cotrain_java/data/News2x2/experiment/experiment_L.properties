# The value of the algorithm property must be the Class implementing AlgorithmIF. 
# This defines the algorithm that will be run, i.e. the experiment that will be performed.

# The list measures to be calculated in the experiment (accuracy, f-measure, ...). 
# Specify as the array of String values separated with whitespace character ("measure1" "measure2" ...) 
# where each String represents the name of the class (full path) that implements MeasureIF interface.   
measures="classificationResult.measures.AccuracyMeasure" "classificationResult.measures.F1Measure" "classificationResult.measures.F1Measure"
# calculate the measure specified above (e.g. f-measure) for this class. Multiple classes can be set, avg means averaged measure
# one class per each measure must be specified

# if loadClassifiers=true, load training classifier statistic from the file specified in ClassifiersFileName property. 
# If false do not load the training classifier statistics. Since supervised experiment L does not depend on the previously generated 
# classifier statistics (as do RSSalg and MajorityVote), this parameter is set to false
loadClassifiers=false

# If writeClassifiers=false record both train and test classifier statistics obtained during algorithm execution. For algorithms that do not 
# label unlabeled instances during execution (settings L and All), i.e. do not create the train statistic,  only the test statistic will 
# be recorded.
writeClassifiers=false

# If writeEnlargedTrainingSet=true the enlarged training set obtained by labeling unlabeled instances and adding them to training data during algorithm execution
# will be recorded. For algorithms that do not label unlabeled instances during execution (settings L and All), this property value will be ignored
writeEnlargedTrainingSet=false
